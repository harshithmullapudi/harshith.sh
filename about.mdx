## **About** 
Hey there! I'm Harshith, a tech nerd building cool stuff with [Tegon](https://github.com/tegonhq/tegon). When I'm not typing away on my laptop, I'm either hitting [badminton]() birdies, traveling to new places, or getting lost in a good book. Tech by day, fun by night!

## **Work**
Currently, co-founder of [Tegon](https://github.com/tegonhq/tegon). My tech journey has been quite the adventure. 
I've built Tegon, [Poozle](https://github.com/poozlehq/poozle), and [Eventbeep](https://eventbeep.com) – it’s been like trying to find the perfect pizza recipe, a lot of trial and error, 
but always delicious in the end.
<br />
Before this, I was the founding engineer at [Velocity](http://velocity.in), where I juggled frontend and data pipelines. 
I also had a stint at [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com) as a success engineer, making sure all the integrations played nice together. 
And before all that, I was a frontend engineer at [Hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com), crafting sleek user interfaces.
<br />
I love building systems that scale and plug in like LEGO blocks, and I'm all about creating simple yet awesome UX. 
I play around with TypeScript, Ruby on Rails, Python, and even dabble in Go and Kubernetes. 
Basically, if tech were a buffet, I'd be the guy trying to fit the whole spread on one plate
